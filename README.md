# Hello-World
This is a repository for Python Learning
My name is Shiyang Feng, and it's prounced as She-Young. I'm now a graduate student at NYU majoring in database technology. The reason for me to join the Github community is because I want to become a data scientist, and I'm self-learning both techinical and non-technical skills myself. I'm currently looking for Python projects to learn more about Python!
